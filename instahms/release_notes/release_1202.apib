# Insta HMS 12.2 Release Notes

## New Features [/]

### Automated PhilHealth and BPJS Billing [GET]

The Case Rate model is the lump sum reimbursement model for in-patient treatments which is gaining a lot of widespread adoption amongst several countries as recommended by the World Health Council. The Case Rate Billing model has been implemented in Insta considering the prevalent rules in Philippines and Indonesia. The Case Rate amounts are the amounts payable by the Government Health Insurance Company to healthcare providers, for a group of related services, based on the expected costs for a clinically defined episode of care. This case rate model applies to all public and private PhilHealth accredited hospitals. The case rate payment system is already "all in" where hospital charges and professional fees are already covered. The difference between case rate system and FFS is that in FFS, the amount of benefits varies depending on the hospital level, doctor's qualification, and severity of illness and complexity of operation but case rate remains same for all.

#### Introduction of New properties in the Insurance Plan Master

**Limit Type**: to determine whether the plan supports the case rate model or not. There are two possible values applicable, Category Based or Case Rate Based.

-   Category based to continue supporting the existing visit/category wise limit billing.

-   Case Rate based enables the case rate model for billing, Philhealth and BPJS Insurance Plans must use this property, all other plans use category based.

-   All visit/category based configuration gets disabled when case rate based limit type is selected. This configuration can not switch over to Category Based once it is saved.

**No. of Case Rates Allowed**: it is to define maximum number of case rates supported by insurance plan. This gets enabled only when Limit Type is Case Rate Based. Allowed count must be 2 for Philhealth Plan.

### Introduction of application-wide Patient Confidentiality Controls [GET]

This feature introduces a new concept of Patient Confidentiality controls across the application so that only authorized users have access to confidential patient details and medical records.

#### Confidentiality Groups Master

Confidentiality Groups Master this allows the admin to setup confidentiality groups and define whether these groups allow i> Break the Glass: a means to allow special users temporary access to a patient record for enabling transactions or access to medical records with mandatory comments. ii> Requires EMR Access Justification Comments: an additional security feature which enforces capturing comments at the time of EMR access. iii> There is an Confidentiality Group Code which is mandated as it displays this code as a tag on transaction screens iv> User applicability: allows the admin to authorize specific users to have access to a Confidentiality Group.

![](media/image1202_33.png)

#### Registration screens

-   The OP Registration screen has the field Patient Confidentiality Groups made available so that during visit or MR No generation the user can mark the patient as part of the respective Patient Confidentiality Group.

    -   The user only has access to select the Patient Confidentiality Groups that the user has authorized access to from the respective Registration screens.

    ![](media/image1202_16.png)

-   The same field is also enabled to the IP / OSP and Pre-Registration as well as Edit Patient Details screen in the old UI.

    ![](media/image1202_32.png)

-   **Patient List:** The Patient List in the OP Flow and the IP Flow has a tag which will display the confidentiality group short code as set up in the masters.

    ![](media/image1202_64.png)

#### Scheduler changes

-   The scheduler pop-up at the time of booking an appointment also displays the Confidentiality tag against the patient.

![](media/image1202_12.png)

-   The Calendar displays the confidential patient details to an authorized user only with the tag.

![](media/image1202_31.png)

-   But to an unauthorized user the slot is displayed as blocked for Consultation/Service/Test etc but masks the patient details and the user is blocked from viewing/modifying the appointment details.

![](media/image1202_62.png)

#### Break the Glass

This is a feature that allows special users temporary access to a patient record for enabling transactions or access to medical records with mandatory comments incase of an emergency as the term "Break the Glass" suggests. This screen can be accessed by authorized users from the Patient menu > Break the Glass and the user can simply search for any patient, enter comments (min 30 characters) and request access.

![](media/image1202_34.png)

-   The following toast is displayed on successful request granted to the user to access the MR No. The user has temporary access till he logs out from the current session after which the access is automatically revoked.

![](media/image1202_37.png)

#### EMR View Justification comments

This is an add-on feature to Patient Confidentiality which enforces user comments every time a user accesses the confidential patient's Patient/Visit EMR. On accessing the EMR view screens there will be a mandatory pop-up which enforces comments from the user to access the patient's EMR medical records.

![](media/image1202_20.png)

#### Application-wide behaviour

There is an application-wide check in all Patient/MRNo search fields and worklists such that the users can access only patients which are either not confidential or the user has authorized access to the respective Patient Confidentiality Groups. The only screens to which this check could not apply are the Insurance modules as this would interfere with the Claim Batching, Submission and Remittance process and Insta classified non-usage modules such as IVF, Davita-Billing, CSSD etc.


### Patient Issues/Returns transaction support for taxes for GCC-VAT compliance [GET]

-   The Issue to Patient screen allows for issuing and billing consumables, reusables and medicines to the patient. In India, this screen is primarily used only for inpatient medication treatment where as per the prevailing taxation rules taxation is exempt and no sales taxation can apply for the patient, hence this automatically doesn't apply if the India-GST rules are applied for the customer. These changes currently apply only when the tax model setup is as per GCC-VAT rules.

-   The tax applies on the Selling Price or Net price i.e. (Gross - Discount) only for the Inventory Item.

-   The tax can be modified on the fly by the user for an item subject to the action right which is "Allow Sub group editing".

-   The customer logo can be uploaded from the admin console and shows up in the top left bar. This enabled white labelling of the Patient Portal and showcases the customer's brand.

-   Book Appointments using the Basic/Advanced Search criteria:

    -   The Basic Search criteria is quite straightforward in the sense that it allows the user to directly search by resource i.e. doctor/department or package/order set name.

    -   The Advanced Search criteria allows the user to select a resource, specify time and category specifically at the time of search. The categories are doctor, department or package.

    ![](media/image1202_8.png)

    ![](media/image1202_50.png)

-   After allowing the user to specify the appointment criteria the availability of the resource is displayed in the second pane. If the user specifies time then the available slot is pre-selected for the user. If the user doesn't specify time available slots for the entire day are displayed.

    ![](media/image1202_10.png)

-   The last step to go ahead and book the appointment is for the user to specify their details such as First Name and Last Name and complete the booking.

    ![](media/image1202_22.png)

-   After Booking is successful a success message with the appointment details are displayed.

    ![](media/image1202_72.png)

## Minor enhancements [/]

### Scheduler [GET]

### Doctor Scheduler 

The Doctor Scheduler now allows users to directly book an appointment from the Calendar View and is not mandated to only book an appointment using the Availability View.

-   Clicking on the calendar view will automatically determine the slot selected and assume the user to wanting to book an appointment for the selected time slot. The user can however change the slot from the drop-down option which is available for selection which shows all available slots for the day.

    ![](media/image1202_61.png)

-   Incase multiple doctors were selected from the Calendar View then the drop-down in the appointment pop-up requires the user to select a doctor to book an appointment.

    ![](media/image1202_11.png)

-   The secondary action on click is now a switcher tab to "Block the Calendar" which retains the existing functionality.

-   Reschedule an appointment across doctors

    -   This can now be done after hitting the Reschedule/Edit action where the user can switch the applicable doctor for the appointment.

#### Availability View

    ![](media/image1202_29.png)

#### Doctor Appointments with Consultation Type based appointment duration

-   The Doctor appointments now apply a rule such that the duration of an appointment is based on the Consultation Type selected and is mandatory for selection to book an appointment.

    ![](media/image1202_51.png)

-   The Consultation Types displayed in the drop-down are only those values which are mapped to the doctor's respective practitioner type.

-   All Consultation Types have been migrated with a default duration based on the Resource Default Availability settings setup for All doctors.

    ![](media/image1202_44.png)

-   For Service appointments we now apply a rule such that the duration of an appointment is based on the Service specific duration. There is also an option to define which Service can be done on which Service Resources, so that while booking a service appointment only those specifically mapped Service Resources are available for selection.

    ![](media/image1202_57.png)

-   For Test appointments, there is also an option to define which Test can be done on which Test Equipments, so that while booking a test appointment only those specifically mapped Test Equipments are available for selection.

    ![](media/image1202_21.png)

-   On the Doctor Calendar the following UI changes were made to enable the user to differentiate based on appointment statuses:

    -   Booked appointments only have the outer tile colored.

        ![](media/image1202_42.png)

    -   Confirmed appointments have the tile filled.

        ![](media/image1202_2.png)

    -   Cancelled appointments have the appointment struck out.

        ![](media/image1202_36.png)

    -   Cancelled appointments can also be hidden from being displayed on the Doctor Calendar.

        ![](media/image1202_13.png)

    -   No Show appointments have the appointments with a color file with a gradient of lines.

        ![](media/image1202_4.png)

-   On the Doctor Calendar(Day/Week View): the user's last selection is stored and defaulted to Week/Day view when the user returns to the Doctor Calendar screen.

-   For Doctor Appointments the status gets marked completed automatically once the doctor consultation gets completed.

-   On the Doctor Calendar Availability View: there is an option to show/hide of Show All Slots.

    ![](media/image1202_67.png)

-   The following Scheduler specific action rights are enabled which are:

    -   Block/Unblock Calendar: so that only an authorized users can block/unblock the calendar for a doctor from the doctor's calendar.

    -   Allow backdated appointments/block calendar: so that only an authorized user can back-date an appointment or back-date and block a doctor's calendar.

-   The System Preferences called "*Registration On Arrival"* has been removed as this was not being used as intended. This preference earlier would allow a schema level setting for deciding whether marking Arrival should take the user to the Registration screen or only update the status.

### Registration [GET]

#### Mark a Patient OP Visit as "Emergency" and if necessary as "Unidentified".

-   The OP Visit Registration screen introduces an option to mark a patient visit as an Emergency visit as well as if necessary to mark the patient as unidentified in case of an MLC (Medico-Legal case) /RTA (Road-Traffic accident)/Disaster cases where there is no patient information available to register the patient.

-   The top-section of the OP Visit Registration screen there are new fields to mark as an "Emergency", and if selected there is an additional option to select the patient as unidentifiable in which case 2 new Registration Preferences and one Center-wise Preferences apply which are a> Unidentified Patient First Name, b> Unidentified Patient Last Name and c> Emergency Patient Default Patient Category.

    -   The Unidentified Patient First Name defaults to John and Unidentified Patient Last Name defaults to Doe on migration for all customers, but as when more unidentified patients are registered the last name Doe has a sequence as One, Two, Three which increments to differentiate each unidentified patient registration from each other.

    -   The center-wise emergency patient default patient category is an additional option to default the patient category selection for Emergency cases.

-   The main feature of marking a patient as an Emergency case is that it overrides all the Registration Preferences which mandate certain fields and only mandates Title, First Name, Last Name, Age, Gender, City and Department fields.

-   The user can always update the patient demographic details at a later time from Edit Patient details and provide complete information.

-   There are 2 attributes added as part of the Visit Details Report Builder to identify the visit registrations done against Emergency and Unidentified patients.

#### New Registration Preferences 

-   There are 2 new OP Registration screen specific Registration preferences which are a> *Patient Photo Mandatory* (which as the name suggests simply mandates capturing patient photo for every OP Registration) and b> "*Patient Outstanding Controls For OP Registration*": there are 2 values to select from, one which is Warn which is an existing functionality and it displays a blue color information warning which gives the front desk user the details that the patient has an outstanding patient due > 0. If set to Block then the user is displayed the same patient due information > 0 in a red color toast but is blocked from proceeding with the OP Registration. In this case the user has to redirect the patient to clear all outstanding patient dues to proceed with a new OP visit registration. This preference doesn't apply to the OSP or IP Registration screens.

-   A previously available back-end Registration Preference called Patient Identification with values = i> Govt Identifier Type or ii> Govt Identifier Type + Passport Fields has now been moved to a center level.

    -   This preference with the option 1 enables capturing Govt ID for all OP visit registrations regardless of with/without insurance and option 2 enables capturing either Govt ID or passport details (if setup on the Registration screen only).

-   There is a new Registration Preference added called Patient Outstanding Controls for OP Registrations, this works such that for a OP visit registration the user could see a blue information toast incase the patient had outstanding dues such as below:

    ![](media/image1202_55.png)

    -   This is now modified such that the preference has two options: warn the user only and proceed for OP visit registration or block the user with the toast and mandatorily clear the patient dues for a new OP visit registration.

#### Other minor changes 

-   There is a minor fix for the smart card integration with the Kuwait Civil ID card such that if the input name from the card has 4 names and the Registration screens are enabled with 2 middle names then the names get split accordingly across First / Middle Name 1 / Middle Name 2 and Last name fields.

-   An earlier feature where if 0 charges were applicable at the time of OP Visit Registration that creation of a bill was skipped has been deprecated as this can cause audit concerns for customers.

-   Death Patient OP and IP Registration control is applied such that if the patient was marked discharged by type = Death, in a previous IP visit then a new visit registration is blocked and a message is displayed which says: "Patient is no longer alive as per records (Date of death: Date Month Year HH:MM). Can not create new visit"

#### Doctor Follow up Rule Changes

## Features in 12.2.1 [/cig-release-01]

### Accounting [GET]

#### Real-Time hospital bill voucher posting and export only on bill finalization

Insta had a model where the transactions such as Bills, Receipts, Inventory transactions etc. are transposed from tables → views → to a centralized accounting table into a journal entry format of accounts/ledgers which are debited and credited respectively. This model was identified to have several inconsistencies especially in the Bill vouchers created such as:

-  Inconsistent reversal postings for transactions such as Cash to Insurance, Insurance to Insurance, Edit Rates, Change claim amounts, Tax amounts etc.

-  As a continuation of 1, inconsistent double postings due to inconsistent reversal postings.

-  Inability of the Accounting Table alone to define/differentiate events at which time a voucher can be exported necessitating database + view based integrations.

-  Lack of APIs for integration based on events such as bill finalization.

The new model of accounting voucher creation is such that it continues to store transactions such as Bills, Receipts, Inventory transactions etc in tables → but a real time job queue will transpose the data → to a centralized accounting table into a journal entry format of accounts/ledgers which are debited and credit respectively.

In this release hospital **bill vouchers are posted realtime to the accounting table only based on bill finalization** negating the need to post noisy reversal entries for the accrual based postings which were applicable in previous releases. Reversal entries are now posted for the following transactions:

Bill Now to Bill Later, Bill Open date change, Bill charge posted date change, Bill charge rate/tax/discount change, OP-IP conversion, Change Rate Plan / Bed Type, Connect/Disconnect Insurance, Change Insurance, Edit Claim Amount, and Reopen on Bill.

Exporting data into an accounting system is a 2 step process within Insta.

-  **Posting of vouchers** to a staging table based on the transactions that have occurred in the system. This is currently real-time for the Bill vouchers and is being extended to all other voucher types subsequently through development.

-  **Exporting of Vouchers** from the staging table to the target accounting system is through published APIs.

The APIs are also enhanced such that the target accounting system can import the vouchers based on the event i.e. bill finalization.

### Registration [GET]

#### ADT/ Registration: Gender controls for Ward/Bed allocation/shifting

The Ward and Bed Details master now has an option to set the allowed gender as all or specifically male or female and this control applies across the application right from the IP Registration, ADT (Bed Allocation/Shift), OP-IP Conversion, Child Birth and Edit Visit details.

#### Search by Insurance Plan Code

For the purpose of ease of selection of the multiple insurance fields such as TPA/Sponsor, Insurance Co, Network Type/Plan Type, Plan etc at the time of OP Registration only. There is now a new field introduced in the Plan Master called 'Plan Code'. This can be used to select insurance plan in OP Registration screen. Only a maximum of 30 characters are allowed in the 'Plan code' field.

![](media/image120201_1.png)

In the Generic preferences there is a configuration 'Plan Code Search For OP Registration'. By default value is 'No'. When this preference is enabled, then in OP registration screen plan code fled will be displayed against the primary & secondary sponsor field sections.

![](media/image120201_2.png)

## Features in 12.2.2 [/cig-release-120202]

### Clinical [GET]

#### New add-on clinical preferences for OP Prescriptions and IP-EMR Physician Orders

The following clinical preferences have been added which are:

-   Show/Hide urgent as an option against a prescribed item.

-   Display the "Till Discontinue" option in IP-EMR Physician Orders

![](media/image120202_2.png)

![](media/image120202_1.png)

![](media/image120202_3.png)

#### Minor IP-EMR Physician Order changes

![](media/image120202_4.png)

## Registration [GET]

#### Registration screen changes to allow names in foreign languages and using extended latin characters

In the Registration screens, there is already a separate field called Name in Local Language. The downside of this is:

-   We cannot universally search for the patient in local language.

-   We cannot send notifications, generate reports or print across the application universally.

The goal of this change was to allow limited entry of patient name in the local language in the OP, IP, OSP and Pre-Registration screens. This is because in the Philippines and Mexico there are patient names with extended latin characters such as: Björk Guðmundsdóttir, María-Jose Carreño Quiñones, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng etc. In addition we need to support patient names directly in Arabic or Chinese.

This change has now been effected on the OP,Pre,IP,OSP Registration screens, the universal patient search, the incoming sample registration screen, the pharmacy sales and quick estimate screens.

-  In earlier versions, Cancelled without refund items are not available, Now such cancelled items are also shown by checking 'Show Cancelled Without Refund' option.

-  All cancelled items will be shown after all active items listed.

-  An alert in case the item ordered is already part of a package and vice-versa.
